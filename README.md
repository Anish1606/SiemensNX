# Siemens NX Models and Assemblies

## Overview
This repository contains 3D models and assembly files created using **Siemens NX**. The files are in **`.prt`** format and are intended for use in design, simulation, and fabrication workflows.


## Requirements
- **Siemens NX**
- Optional: **Teamcenter** or **NX Viewer** for collaboration and review.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Anish1606/SiemensNX.git
    ```
2. Open the `.prt` files in Siemens NX.
3. If assemblies reference parts, ensure the correct file paths or configure **Load Options** for seamless assembly loading.

## Conventions
- All dimensions are in **millimetres (mm)**.
- Files follow **Siemens NX naming conventions**.
- **Third-angle projection** used for drawing standards.


## Notes
- These files are intended for design and review purposes.
- For manufacturing, please ensure you use the correct version of Siemens NX and verify all dimensions and tolerances.
